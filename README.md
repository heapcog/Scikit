What is Scikit-Learn (Sklearn)?
Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. This library, which is largely written in Python, is built upon NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.

Before we start using scikit-learn latest release, we require the following:
Software | Version
-------|-------
Python | (>=3.5)
NumPy | (>= 1.11.0)
Scipy | (>= 0.17.0)
Joblib | (>= 0.11)
Matplotlib | (>= 1.5.1) is required for Sklearn plotting capabilities.
Pandas | (>= 0.18.0) is required for some of the scikit-learn examples using data structure and analysis
VS code | 1.521

Scikit has three interfaces
> Estimator -- To build fitting the models
> Predictor -- To make predictions
> Transformer -- To convert Data
